          <p>I hope this message finds you and your furry friend well.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A while back, we sent out a bottle of Advanced Joint Support from a batch that did not meet our strict quality standards. The supplements in the bottle were oxidized due to some leakage or breach in packaging.</p>
          <br>
          <p>On behalf of the Vetrinex Labs team, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience or disappointment this may have caused you and your furry friend.</p>

          <br>
          <p>As a token of apology, we are sending you a complimentary replacement bottle of Advanced Joint Support. This new bottle comes from our latest batch, ensuring that it meets our high standards of potency and efficacy.</p>
          <br>
          <p>You should receive your bottle within the next few days.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We understand how important your pooch‚Äôs health and happiness are, and we promise to provide supplements that deliver visible improvements and results.</p>

          <p>Hello ABC!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I know you‚Äôve felt it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The urge to keep cozy in bed in winters wakes up the procrastination devil inside all of us.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But it‚Äôs not just us. Our dogs need a little extra push to stay active during the colder months!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Do you know why?</p>
          <br>
          <p>Dropping temperatures thicken up the fluids in joints and cause joint tissues to become larger bringing about stiffness and pain.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But, you can do these 5 things to help your pup not just have healthy joints but a happy, enjoyable winter:</p>
          <br>
          <ol style="margin-left: 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Weight check:</strong> Holiday weight is not just a common hooman concern. Cold weather usually brings about a reduction in activity resulting in weight gain during the winter months. Keep track of your doggie‚Äôs weight, because obesity or so much as a little increase in weight adds pressure to their joints.</li>

        <li><strong>Activities and fun:</strong> Staying indoors can be a whole lotta fun too! Play games like hide and seek, puzzles, tug, and you can even set up playdates with your pups best buddies.</li>

        <li><strong>Keeping them warm and cozy:</strong> A warm puppy is a pain-free puppy. Joint stiffness during colder months can be relieved by keeping them warm through orthopedic pet beds and heat mats, just remember that the heat mat shouldn‚Äôt come in direct contact with your pup. Gears like coats, jumpers, and non-slip booties will help keep them warm when outdoors.</li>

        <li><strong>Regular Check-ups:</strong> Joint problems like arthritis tend to worsen temporarily during the colder months. Regular vet visits to keep your pups health in check is a must, especially if you have an older dog.</li>

        <li><strong>Joint Health Supplements and Therapies:</strong> Joint health supplements containing glucosamine is a great way to keep your pup pain-free and moving. If your pup has severe arthritis, you could also try red light therapy, the deep penetrating heat does wonders for stiff and sore joints.</li>
    </ol>
         <br>
          <p>Is your dog ready for the winter? If not, I hope these tips help!</p>
         <br>
          <p>Happy winters üòâ</p>
          <br>
          <p>Regards,<br>XYZ</p>

          <p>With all the instagram reels going around where vet chiropractors crack and crinkle the spine, you must‚Äôve thought whether to take your canine to one.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs the big question. Should I get a chiropractic adjustment for my dog?</p>
          <br>
          <p>Plain and simple:</p>
          <br>
          <p>Chiropractic or spinal adjustment is safe for adult dogs.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It isn‚Äôt a traditional treatment method, neither is it a standalone treatment for spinal health.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, as a supplement to mainstream doggie care, it can help your dog with conditions like osteoarthritis, back or neck pain, nervous system problems or hip dysplasia. It can also be an excellent preventative measure.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, keep it away from the little ones!</p>
          <br>
          <p>It is advised that puppies aren‚Äôt taken to chiropractors, because their bodies haven‚Äôt fully formed yet. So they are still too delicate for such manipulations that can increase the risk of injury.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Take an informed decision only after talking to your vet.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Have a good day!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Regards,<br>XYZ</p>
